/* DATA TYPES IN JS 
We will be working with the lists of data types we have. 
i will explain each of them as simple as i can. we have: 
Strings
Numbers
Boolean
Undefined
null
symbol. this is not commonly used, But like i said, 
No knowledge is a waste. so i will explain all. */

// these dataTypes work mostly with variables. for example.

const name = 'Chace'; // The quotes like i said in previous lessons symbolizes a string.
const age = 34; // Without the quotes now, it prints the value of the number varaibel. for you.
const rating = 4.5; // this will ignore the decimal point, i will explain why shortly.
const isCool = true; // This seems to be self explanatory, You are just gibing a command to something if its true or false.
const x = null; // This simply means something is empty, the data of x is empty. thats why we have null.
const y = undefined; // This means a variable isn't defined. for instance we do not have something stored in y
let z;

console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof age);
console.log(typeof rating);
console.log(typeof isCool);
console.log(typeof x);
console.log(typeof y);

// This will give you the data types of eachof these variables.
// undefined and null are actually errors, because they must always take in a value.
