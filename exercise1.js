// First class, We will be learning commenting.

// There are two types of commenting,
// BUt before we proceed, I will tell you what a comment is.

// A comment or commenting means, writing plain notes in the workspace and indirectly telling
// the computer to ignore the plain text and run the codes.
// This is useful when you want to write something in the code for
// Your team mates or yourself when you want to
// Remember what something does.

// Notice how i am using a double slash befor writing this texts?
// That's me commanding the computer to ignore it.
// and this is the first way for you to comment. Now on to the second way of commenting.

//  It would be stressful to have to put slashes
//  before any text no matter how long the lines

// this is why you should use a / asterics and another asterics with a closing slash.

/* This is an example of writing comments on multiple lines without having to put
slashes on every line. Now when you run this in the console. you will see nothing, Because
we have simple told the computer to ignore it. 
I am teaching you this first cause we will be using a lot of this 
through out the class.  */
