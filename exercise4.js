 Picture a piggy bank, where you keep your money, 
You have a piggy bank, and you have a little hole where you poke your money through
like a box, This is a Variable, a store for words or texts which you will
use predominantly in your codes, It saves you the stress
pf having to write it everytime. so all you just need to do is 
write either of these three command 'var', 'let', 'const' and give it any name, then you 
console log it. it will give you the value for that name. example below */

var b = 'Smoothie';
console.log(b);

// You will get Smoothie in the console. cause Smoothie is stored in 'b'.

// another example for Numbers.

const someNumber = 45;
console.log(someNumber);

// You will get 45 in the console when you run this.
